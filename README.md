# Ford GoBike System Data
## by **Mark Wamiru**


## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 183,412 trips made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The data includes features such as duration (secs) and others such as start_station_id, user type, gender, as well as some additional variables. The dataset can be downloaded from here [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv)


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found out that mos trips were about 500 seconds.

Most of the trips (90.53%) were taken by subscribers whereas on customers only contributed to 9.47% of the people who went for trips. 

In general, males went for trips more than any of the other genders, making up 74.59% of the distribution. However, males tended to have the shortest trips among the 3 genders, with **others** having the longest trips.

Most of the users tended not to share the bikes during their trips. It also seems as though users of type customer weren't allowed to share bikes or just never requested for sharing.

Most users tend to fall between the ages of 20 and 40.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the features that seemed to play a role in the lengt of the duration of the trip. These features in focus included age, gender, user type and bike sharing. I start by introducing the duration variable and its distribution.

I then focus on the distribution of gender using a histogram. This is then followed by a bar plot used to show the average length of a trip for each gender category. I finally use pointplots to show user type and bike sharing influence trip duration and also how gender and bike sharing play a part in the duration of the trip.
